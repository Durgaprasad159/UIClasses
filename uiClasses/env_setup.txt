			**** GitHub Environement ****


=> GitHub is the Repository.

=> GitHub is open source Repository maintained by google.

=> in real world, all projects must and should connect to repository.

=> because of repository, parallel development possible.

=> because of repositories, productivity will be incresed.


Topics
------

1) installation of Git.

2) create the GitHub Account.

3) Create the Repository in GitHub.

4) Commit & Push the Projects to GitHub.

5) Pull the Projects from GitHub.

		***** installation of Git *****

	- GitHub is the repository.

	- to Interact with GitHub we need "Git" software.


website : https://git-scm.com/download/win

file    : Git-2.24.0.2-64-bit.exe



		***** create the GitHub Account *****


we will visit following website to create the GitHub Account


URL : https://github.com/

	- once if we create account, 
	  please remember GitHub Credentials

User Email : xxxxxxxxxxx

Password  : xxxxxxxxxxx


		**** Create the Repository in GitHub ****


URL : https://github.com/ajsnaresh/UIClasses.git

	above "URL" representing repository path.

	in above repository, we can perform PUSH & PULL Operations.



	    **** Commit & Push the Projects to GitHub ****

=> link the "GitHub" to "Git tool" by using "Git Bash".


	Open the GitBash Terminal in windows and execute 
	the following Commands


	> git config --global user.email "xxxxxxxxxx"

	> git config --global user.name "xxxxxxx"


=> open the "VSCode IDE"  (Visual Studio Code)

=> Commit the files  (p_1.png)

=> add the cloud repository Address

	- Open the Terminal in VSCode (view=>terminal)

	- execute the following command

	> git remote add origin 
	  https://github.com/ajsnaresh/UIClasses.git

=> push files to GitHub


         **** Clone the Projects from GitHub to Local Environement *****


=> open VSCode

=> goto view=>Command Pallette

=> Type Git:Clone

=> enter repository URL
		https://github.com/ajsnaresh/UIClasses

=> Select the Destination to clone the Projects
		Ex.
				Desktop/Demo

=> Open the Clonned Repository



					***** HTML ******

HTML

JavaScript   (ES6 to ES2020)

JSON   (jQuery with AJAX Calls)

Angular9

ReactJS

NodeJS

DataBases

	MySQL

	FireBase

MEAN Stack Development

MERN Stack Development


- HTML Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

- HTML Released by W3C Organization.

- Advanced Version of HTML is HTML5.

- Both HTML & HTML5 used to develop the Web Pages.

- In General webpages Executed by Browser Engines.

	Ex.
			Google Chrome
			Mozilla
			NetScape
			IE
			---
			---
			---
- If WebPages loaded into Browser Engines, then only we
  will see the Output.

- In General we will Develop HTML,HTML5 by using Tags.

- These Tags are Given by Vendor (W3C)

- All these Tags Located in Cloud with Particular 
  DOCTYPE

- DOCTYPE is the "Address of Tags"

Ex.

	HTML5 DOCTYPE
	-------------
	<!DOCTYPE html>

	[Note : if above doctype present, then that webpages
	called as HTML5 webpages]

- Major Differences Between HTML & HTML5 is.

=> HTML Not Mobile Friendly  & HTML5 is Mobile Friendly

=> we can't run JavaScript in Background By Using HTML
   we can run HTML as Background by using HTML5

=> HTML won't supports any API'S
   HTML5 Supports API'S like	
		LocalStorage
		SessionStorage
		WebWorkers
		WebSockets
		Cookies
		----
		----
		----
  - when ever we close the browser, we won't lost the
    data from LocalStorage.

  - when ever we close the browser, we will lost the data from SessionStorage.

  - we can run multiple tasks, by using WebWorkers.

  - we will implement chat applications by using WebSockets

  - we will store the data in the form of a key & value pairs in Browser Memory by using cookies

  - By Default HTML won't Supports Audio & Videos

  - HTML5 Supports Audios & Videos by predefined Tags in HTML5.
